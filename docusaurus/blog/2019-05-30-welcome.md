Version 3 is a complete re-write from the ground up with the following exciting features:

- Completely written in **Typescript**
- **Composable API**, every part of the chart is its own component.
- Very few dependencies (total package size is only **62 kilobytes**)
- New **documentation website** with extensive examples

Due to the nature of the changes, version 2.2 and below is now no longer supported. You can find the [old docs here](https://github.com/N1ghtly/react-native-responsive-linechart/blob/master/README-v2.2.md).
